=head1 NAME

Parse::CSV - Highly flexible CSV parser for large files

=head1 VERSION

version 2.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Simple headerless comma-seperated column parser
  my $simple = Parse::CSV->new(
      file => 'file.csv',
  );

  while ( my $array_ref = $simple->fetch ) {
     # Do something...
  }

... or a more complex example...

  # Parse a colon-seperated variables file  from a handle as a hash
  # based on headers from the first line.
  # Then filter, so we emit objects rather than the plain hash.
  my $objects = Parse::CSV->new(
      handle => $io_handle,
      sep_char   => ';',
      names      => 1,
      filter     => sub { My::Object->new( $_ ) },
  );

  while ( my $object = $objects->fetch ) {
      $object->do_something;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Surely the CPAN doesn't need yet another CSV parsing module.

L<Text::CSV_XS> is the standard parser for CSV files. It is fast as hell,
but unfortunately it can be a bit verbose to use.

A number of other modules have attempted to put usability wrappers around
this venerable module, but they have all focused on parsing the entire
file into memory at once.

This method is fine unless your CSV files start to get large. Once that
happens, the only existing option is to fall back on the relatively slow
and heavyweight L<XML::SAXDriver::CSV> module.

L<Parse::CSV> fills this functionality gap. It provides a flexible
and light-weight streaming parser for large, extremely large, or
arbitrarily large CSV files.

=head2 Main Features

B<Stream-Based Parser> - All parsing a line at a time.

B<Array Mode> - Parsing can be done in simple array mode, returning
a reference to an array if the columns are not named.

B<Hash Mode> - Parsing can be done in hash mode, putting the data into
a hash and returning a reference to it.

B<Filter Capability> - All items returned can be passed through a
custom filter. This filter can either modify the data on the fly,
or drop records you don't need.

=head2 Writing Filters

A L<Parse::CSV> filter is a subroutine reference that is passed the
original record as C<$_> (not as a function argument), and should
C<return> the alternative or modified record.

A no-op filter (does not modify or drop any records) would look like the
following.

  sub { $_ }

A filter that reversed the order of the columns (assuming the parser
is in array mode) might look like the following.

  sub { [ reverse @$_ ] }

To drop the record, return C<undef> from the filter. The
parser will then keep pulling and parsing new records until one
passes the filter.

  # Only keep records where the 'foo' field is true
  sub { $_->{foo} ? $_ : undef }

To signal an error, throw an exception

  sub {
      $_->{foo} =~ /bar/ or die "Assumption failed";
      return $_;
  }

Feel free to modify C<$_> as a side-effect of your filter routine -
this will have no effect on anything.

# Constructor

=pod

=head2 new

The C<new> constructor creates and initialises a new CSV parser.  It
returns a new L<Parse::CSV> object, or throws an exception (dies) on
error.  It accepts a number of params:

=over 4

=item C<file>

=item C<handle>

To specify the CSV data source, provide either the C<file>
param, which should be the name of the file to read, or the C<handle>
param, which should be a file handle to read instead.

=item C<csv_attr>

Any parameter for L<Text::CSV_XS>'s constructor can also be provided
to this C<new> method, and they will be passed on to it.
Alternatively, they can be passed as a single C<HASH> reference as the
C<csv_attr> param. For example:

  $parser = Parse::CSV->new(
      file     => 'file.csv',
      csv_attr => {
          sep_char   => ';',
          quote_char => "'",
      },
  );

=item C<names>

An optional C<names> param can be provided, which should either be an
array reference containing the names of the columns:

  $parser = Parse::CSV->new(
      file  => 'file.csv',
      names => [ 'col1', 'col2', 'col3' ],
  );

or a true value that's not a reference, indicating that the column
names will be read from the first line of the input:

  $parser = Parse::CSV->new(
      file  => 'file.csv',
      names => 1,
  );

If the C<names> param is provided, the parser will map each line to a
hash where the keys are the field names provided, and the values are the
values found in the CSV file.

If the C<names> param is B<not> provided, the parser will return simple
array references of the columns.

=item C<filter>

The optional C<filter> param will be used to filter the records if
provided. It should be a C<CODE> reference or any otherwise callable
scalar, and each value parsed (either array reference or hash reference)
will be available to the filter as C<$_> to be changed or converted into an object,
or whatever you wish.  See the L<Writing Filters> section for more details.

# Main Methods

=pod

=head2 fetch

Once a L<Parse::CSV> object has been created, the C<fetch> method is
used to parse and return the next value from the CSV file.

Returns an C<ARRAY>, C<HASH> or the output of the filter, based on the
configuration of the object, or C<undef> in a variety of situations.

Returning C<undef> means either some part of the parsing and filtering
process has resulted in an error, B<or> that the end of file has been
reached.

On receiving C<undef>, you should check the C<errstr> method. If it is an empty
string you have reached the end of file. Otherwise the error message will
be returned. Thus, the basic usage of L<Parse::CSV> will look like the
following.

  my $parser = Parse::CSV->new(
      file => 'file.csv',
      );
  while ( my $value = $parser->fetch ) {
      # Do something...
  }
  if ( $parser->errstr ) {
      # Handle errors...
  }

NOTE: currently the L<fields> and L<string> methods can be used to
access the most recently-read row (as an array ref or a formatted
string) after using C<fetch>.  However, this contradicts the
documentation for L<Text::CSV_XS>, which says those methods should be
"meaningless" after calling C<getline> (which C<fetch()> internally
uses to read the input).  Keeping the current behavior also incurs a
speed & memory penalty.  Therefore, relying on L<fields> and L<string>
to return the current data after C<fetch()> is deprecated and will
(probably) be removed in a future release.

=cut

sub fetch {
	my $self = shift;

	# The filter can skip rows,
	# iterate till we get something.
	while ( my $row = $self->getline ) {
		# Turn the array ref into a hash if needed
		my $rv;
		if ( $self->{names} ) {
			$rv = {};
			@{$rv}{@{$self->{names}}} = @$row;
		} else {
			$rv = $row;
		}

		# Just return for simple uses
		return $rv unless $self->{filter};

		# Filter if needed
		$rv = eval { local $_ = $rv; $self->{filter}->() };
		if ( $@ ) {
			# Handle filter errors
			$self->{errstr} = "Filter error: $@";
			$self->{errstr} =~ s/^(.+)at line.+$/$1/;
			return undef;
		}

		# Filter returns undef to drop a record
		next unless defined $rv;

		# We have a good record, return it
		return $rv;
	}

	return undef;
}

=head2 getline

Returns the next line of the input as an array reference, without
performing possible conversion to a hash, and without running any
filters.  This is the routine that C<fetch()> uses internally to read
its input.  It may be useful if you sometimes want to do filtering and
sometimes don't, or sometimes want to do hash conversion and sometimes
don't, or maybe you don't need either of those things and you just
want to shave all the milliseconds off that you can (but then you
might be better off just using C<Text::CSV> directly).

=cut

sub getline {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->{errstr} = '';

	my $row = $self->{csv_xs}->getline( $self->{handle} );

	if (!$row && 0+$self->{csv_xs}->error_diag) {
		my $err = "".$self->{csv_xs}->error_diag;
		# We need to propagate errors from Text::CSV_XS, but
		# eof is also reported as an error. So we are going to
		# filter out it as a special case.
		if (!eof $self->{handle} || $err !~ /^EOF/) {
			$self->{errstr} = $err;
		}
	}

	$self->{row}++ if defined $row;
	$self->{savedrow} = $row;
	return $row;
}

=pod

=head2 row

The C<row> method returns the line number of the most-recently-read row of the CSV file.

This is a one-based count, so when you first create the parser,
the value of C<row> will be zero (unless you are using
C<names> on automatic in which case it will be 1).

=cut

sub row {
	$_[0]->{row};
}

=pod

=head2 combine

  $status = $csv->combine(@columns);

The C<combine> method is provided as a convenience, and is passed through
to the underlying L<Text::CSV_XS> object.

=cut

sub combine {
	shift->{csv_xs}->combine(@_);
}

=pod

=head2 string

  $line = $csv->string;

The C<string> method is provided as a convenience, and is passed through
to the underlying L<Text::CSV_XS> object.

NOTE: relying on L<string> to return the current data after C<fetch()>
is deprecated and will (probably) be removed in a future release.
Only rely on its value after C<combine()>.  See similar warnings in
L<fetch()> and L<fields()>.

=cut

sub string {
	my $self = shift;
	if ($self->{savedrow}) {
	  $self->combine(@{$self->{savedrow}});
	  delete $self->{savedrow};
	}
	$self->{csv_xs}->string;
}

=pod

=head2 print

  $status = $csv->print($io, $columns);

The C<print> method is provided as a convenience, and is passed through
to the underlying L<Text::CSV_XS> object.

=cut

sub print {
	shift->{csv_xs}->print(@_);
}

=pod

=head2 fields

  @fields = $csv->fields;

The C<fields> method is provided as a convenience, and is passed through
to the underlying L<Text::CSV_XS> object. It shows the actual row as an array.

NOTE: relying on L<fields> to return the current data after C<fetch()>
is deprecated and will (probably) be removed in a future release.
Only rely on its value after C<combine()>.  See similar warnings in
L<fetch()> and L<string()>.

=cut

sub fields {
	my $self = shift;
	if ($self->{savedrow}) {
	  $self->combine(@{$self->{savedrow}});
	  delete $self->{savedrow};
	}
	$self->{csv_xs}->fields;
}

=pod

=head2 names

  # Get the current column names in use
  my @names = $csv->names;

  # Change the column names on the fly mid stream
  $csv->names( 'fn1', 'fn2' );

The C<names> method gets or sets the column name mapping for the parser.

If the parser has no names or fields, returns the null list.

=cut

sub names {
	my $self  = shift;
	my $names = $self->{names};
	if ( $names ) {
		@$names = @_ if @_;
		return @$names;
	}
	$self->{names} = [ @_ ] if @_;
	return @_;
}

=pod

=head2 errstr

On error, the C<errstr> method returns the error that occured.

If the last action was NOT an error, returns the null string C<''>.

=cut

sub errstr {
	$_[0]->{errstr};
}

1;

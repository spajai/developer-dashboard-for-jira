=head1 VERSION

version 2.67

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch;

  my $log = Log::Dispatch->new(
      outputs => [
          [
              'Code',
              min_level => 'emerg',
              code      => \&_log_it,
          ],
      ]
  );

  sub _log_it {
      my %p = @_;

      warn $p{message};
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module supplies a simple object for logging to a subroutine reference.

=for Pod::Coverage new log_message

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

The constructor takes the following parameters in addition to the standard
parameters documented in L<Log::Dispatch::Output>:

=over 4

=item * code ($)

The subroutine reference.

=back

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

The subroutine you provide will be called with a hash of named arguments. The
two arguments are:

=over 4

=item * level

The log level of the message. This will be a string like "info" or "error".

=item * message

The message being logged.

=back

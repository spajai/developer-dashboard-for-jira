=head1 NAME

Log::Dispatch::Screen - Object for logging to the screen

=head1 VERSION

version 2.67

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch;

  my $log = Log::Dispatch->new(
      outputs => [
          [
              'Screen',
              min_level => 'debug',
              stderr    => 1,
              newline   => 1
          ]
      ],
  );

  $log->alert("I'm searching the city for sci-fi wasabi");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an object for logging to the screen (really
C<STDOUT> or C<STDERR>).

Note that a newline will I<not> be added automatically at the end of a
message by default. To do that, pass C<< newline => 1 >>.

The handle will be autoflushed, but this module opens it's own handle to fd 1
or 2 instead of using the global C<STDOUT> or C<STDERR>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

The constructor takes the following parameters in addition to the standard
parameters documented in L<Log::Dispatch::Output>:

=over 4

=item * stderr (0 or 1)

Indicates whether or not logging information should go to C<STDERR>. If
false, logging information is printed to C<STDOUT> instead.

This defaults to true.

=item * utf8 (0 or 1)

If this is true, then the output uses C<binmode> to apply the
C<:encoding(UTF-8)> layer to the relevant handle for output. This will not
affect C<STDOUT> or C<STDERR> in other parts of your code.

This defaults to false.

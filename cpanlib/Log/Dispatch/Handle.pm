=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch;

  my $log = Log::Dispatch->new(
      outputs => [
          [
              'Handle',
              min_level => 'emerg',
              handle    => $io_socket_object,

  );

  $log->emerg('I am the Lizard King!');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module supplies a very simple object for logging to some sort of
handle object. Basically, anything that implements a C<print()>
method can be passed the object constructor and it should work.

parameters documented in L<Log::Dispatch::Output>:
